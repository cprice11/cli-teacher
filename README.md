# CLI Teacher

I'd like for this to be a way to better utilize the shell.

I want to be able to learn new commands and improve my understanding of the ones that I already am using

I think Tealdeer or a similar documentation tool in connection with a history analyzer and a bit of random choice should do the trick.

They seem to have this use in mind [already](https://tealdeer-rs.github.io/tealdeer/tips_and_tricks.html)
